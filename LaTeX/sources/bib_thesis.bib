abstract = {Abstract Flow-equations are introduced in order to bring Hamiltonians closer to diagonalization. It is characteristic for these equations that matrix-elements between degenerate or almost degenerate states do not decay or decay very slowly. In order to understand different types of physical systems in this framework it is probably necessary to classify various types of these degeneracies and to investigate the corresponding physical behavior. In general these equations generate many-particle interactions. However, for an n-orbital model the equations for the two-particle interaction are closed in the limit of large n. Solutions of these equations for a one-dimensional model are considered. There appear convergency problems, which are removed, if instead of diagonalization only a block-diagonalization into blocks with the same number of quasiparticles is performed.},

title = {Bose polarons in ultracold atoms in one dimension: beyond the Fröhlich paradigm},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {Mobile impurity atoms immersed in Bose–Einstein condensates provide a new platform for exploring Bose polarons. Recent experimental advances in the field of ultracold atoms make it possible to realize such systems with highly tunable microscopic parameters and to explore equilibrium and dynamical properties of polarons using a rich toolbox of atomic physics. In this paper we present a detailed theoretical analysis of Bose polarons in one-dimensional systems of ultracold atoms. By combining a non-perturbative renormalization group approach with numerically exact diffusion Monte Carlo calculations we obtain not only detailed numerical results over a broad range of parameters but also qualitative understanding of different regimes of the system. We find that an accurate description of Bose polarons requires the inclusion of two-phonon scattering terms which go beyond the commonly used Fröhlich model. Furthermore we show that when the Bose gas is in the strongly interacting regime, one needs to include interactions between the phonon modes. We use several theoretical approaches to calculate the polaron energy and its effective mass. The former can be measured using radio-frequency spectroscopy and the latter can be studied experimentally using impurity oscillations in a harmonic trapping potential. We compare our theoretical results for the effective mass to the experiments by Catani et al (2012 Phys. Rev. A 85 023623). In the weak-to-intermediate coupling regimes we obtain excellent quantitative agreement between theory and experiment, without any free fitting parameter. We supplement our analysis by full dynamical simulations of polaron oscillations in a shallow trapping potential. We also use our renormalization group approach to analyze the full phase diagram and identify regions that support repulsive and attractive polarons, as well as multi-particle bound states.}

abstract = {Among the most popular methods for the solution of the Initial Value Problem are the Runge–Kutta pairs of orders 5 and 4. These methods can be derived solving a system of nonlinear equations for its coefficients. To achieve this, we usually admit various simplifying assumptions. The most common of them are the so-called row simplifying assumptions. Here we neglect them and present an algorithm for the construction of Runge–Kutta pairs of orders 5 and 4 based only in the first column simplifying assumption. The result is a pair that outperforms other known pairs in the bibliography when tested to the standard set of problems of DETEST. A cost free fourth order formula is also derived for handling dense output.}
