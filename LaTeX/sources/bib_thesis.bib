abstract = {First we give an introduction to the method of diagonalizing or block-diagonalizing continuously a Hamiltonian and explain how this procedure can be used to analyse the two-dimensional Hubbard model. Then we give a short survey on applications of this flow equation on other models. Finally we outline, how symmetry breaking can be introduced by means of a symmetry breaking of the normal ordering, not of the Hamiltonian.}
