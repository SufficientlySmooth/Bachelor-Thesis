    \caption{Visualization of how the flow progresses for $\eta=10$ by shading larger absolute values for $V_{k,k^\prime},W_{k,k^\prime}$ darker. We see that good suppression occurs for all $W_{k,k^\prime}$, with slower convergence for smaller $|k|,|k^\prime|$.  Meanwhile, the matrix elements near the diagonal $V_{k,k}$ decay significantly slower than most off-diagonal elements. Also, matrix elements $V_{k,-k}$ converge, but to a value different from zero.}
