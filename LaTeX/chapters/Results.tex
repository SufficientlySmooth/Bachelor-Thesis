\chapter{Applying the Flow Equations: 1D Bose Polaron in the Heavy Impurity Limit}\label{Results}
In this section we will present the results of applying the flow equations the LLP-Hamiltonian in the heavy impurity limit. We will see that under certain conditions excellent agreement of the ground state energy and the full spectrum as determined by the flow equations can be obtained when compared with the result of exact diagonalization using a Bogoliubov transformation. %To verify this, we will look at the ground state energy and then at the full spectrum that can be obtained by the two methods. 
The quality of the agreement depends strongly on how long the flow is traversed, which is why we will close by qualitatively analyzing the convergence properties of the flow equations.
\section{In Combination with a Bogoliubov Transformation}
\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption[Flow Visualization for $\eta=10$]{Visualization of how the flow progresses for $\eta=10$ by shading larger absolute values for $V_{k,k^\prime},W_{k,k^\prime}$ darker. It is of note that on the ordinate and abscissa $0\widehat = \pm \lambda_{IR}\xi=\pm 0.1$. We see that good suppression occurs for all $W_{k,k^\prime}$, with slower convergence for smaller $|k|,|k^\prime|$.  Meanwhile, the matrix elements near the diagonal $V_{k,k}$ decay significantly slower than most off-diagonal elements. Also, matrix elements $V_{k,-k}$ converge, but to a value different from zero. Note that the values of $V$ near the main diagonal would  become even smaller if the flow were to progress further. This can be checked numerically by checking if $\mathrm{sgn}\left( V_{k,k^\prime}\right)=-\mathrm{sgn}\left( \partial_\lambda V_{k,k^\prime}\right)$.}
    \label{FlowIllustration}
\end{figure}
As seen in Figure \ref{FlowIllustration}, the flow equations achieve the desired diagonalization except for terms $V_{k,-k}$. This is because $\omega_k=\omega_{-k}\forall k$ implies that the first order contribution in $\partial_\lambda V_{k,-k} =...$ vanishes. This is not a problem for the main diagonal terms $V_{k,k}$ because those have been "manually" set to zero by moving them in the diagonal part $\ham_0$ of the Hamiltonian. We can conclude that if we were not to stop the flow at a finite $\lambda$, our Hamiltonian would be approximately of the form 
\begin{equation}
\ham^\prime \defeq \Sum_{k}\left(\tilde\omega_k \CR_k\AN_k + \tilde V_{k,-k}\CR_k\AN_{-k}\right)
\end{equation}
for some $\tilde\omega_k,\tilde V_{k,-k}$.\\
In principle, this could be brought into diagonal form by performing a Bogoliubov transformation for each summand by hand. But we will use the more general Bogoliubov transformation \ref{Bogoliubov Transformation Def}\footnote{For the numerics we refer to the source code "Bogoliubov\_Transformation.py" in \url{https://github.com/SufficientlySmooth/Bachelor-Thesis-Numerics}} instead because, as can be seen in the figure \ref{FlowIllustrationInsufficient}, there are interaction strengths where not all $W_{k,k^\prime}$ vanish.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption[Flow Visualization for $\eta=-5.1$]{Visualization of the flow progression for $\eta=-5.1$ analogous to Figure \ref{FlowIllustration}. We can see that for this $\eta$ not all of the $W_{k,k^\prime}$ vanish, which may be related to the fact that we are now observing a system with a thermodynamic instability, as will become clear later on. The entailing negative eigenenergies can lead to unexpected behavior of the second order terms in the flow equations.}
    \label{FlowIllustrationInsufficient}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Ground State Energy for Different Interaction Strengths}
One might think that we are therefore at an inherently poor starting point for making predictions about interesting system properties such as the ground state energy. However, it turns out that the many matrix elements that are actually suppressed sufficiently quickly dominate the behavior for the ground state energy to such an extent that if one discards all off-diagonal elements (regardless of their magnitude) after a certain point in the flow, very good agreement with the ground state energy predicted by a Bogoliubov transformation can be reached.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/plots/PDF/GS_energies_bog_flow_comp.pdf}
    \caption[Ground state energy of Bose Polaron for different $\eta$]{The left subplot shows the ground state energy for different $\eta$. The results are obtained via three different approaches: First a Bogoliubov transformation is applied directly to the Hamiltonian \ref{Ham_LLP_qudratic}. Second, the ground state energy is given by the constant $\epsilon$ in the flow Hamiltonian \ref{Flow_Hamiltonian_for_purely_quadratic_case} if all off-diagonal elements are neglected after a sufficiently long traversal of the flow. Third, the off-diagonal elements are not neglected but instead set to zero by a Bogoliubov Transformation of the flow Hamiltonian after traversing the flow for as long as in the second case.
The right subplot shows the difference between the ground state energy and the constant terms in the Hamiltonian \ref{Ham_LLP_qudratic} to better highlight the (slight) differences between the three approaches.\\
}
    \label{GSenergiesBogFlow}
\end{figure}
The agreement of the first and third approach in Figure \ref{GSenergiesBogFlow} is not surprising, since the flow equation approach transforms the Hamiltonian in infinitesimal \emph{unitary} steps. The good behavior of the second method (stand-alone flow equations) seems plausible once we consider that $\mathcal O(N^2)$ matrix elements flow towards the diagonal, where of course the unitarity of the transformation conserves the trace of Hamiltonian (i.e. the sum of its eigenenergies). The number of $V_{k,k^\prime}$ that do not converge to 0 is only $\mathcal O(N)$, and the number of $W_{k,k^\prime}$ that do not converge to 0 is $\mathcal O(1)$. Therefore, assuming that these terms converge to values that are too large and do not diverge, we expect negligible contributions of these terms to the sum of the eigenenergies if a unitary transformation were performed that would actually make these terms vanish. Now, because the ground state energy depends on the sum of the eigenvalues (see eq. \ref{GS_energy_formula}), the prediction for the ground state energy for our system is very accurate. It is noteworthy that the ground state energy in the limit $\eta\rightarrow\pm\infty$ is the same. This is because the two branches are adiabatically connected \cite{Grusdt_2017,PhysRevA.98.033610}. This can, for example, be shown by noticing that the ground state energy is a smooth function of $1/\eta$ at $1/\eta=0$ \cite[Fig. 1]{PhysRevA.98.033610}.\\
An accurate prediction of the ground state energy does not necessarily imply that all eigenenergies are predicted accurately too. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/plots/PDF/spectrum_analysis_bog_flow_comp.pdf}
    \caption[Characteristic eigenenergies of the Bose Polaron for different $\eta$]{The left subplot shows the smallest real (SR) and smallest real positive (SP) eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian for different $\eta$. The right subplot illustrates in which regime dynamical instabilities (i.e. imaginary eigenvalues) occur.
}
    \label{SpectrumAnalysis}
\end{figure}
For example, the difference in the ground state energy in Figure \ref{GSenergiesBogFlow} for $\eta\approx -3.5$, which becomes especially clear when looking at the right subplot, can be explained by the fact that in this regime imaginary eigenvalues are to be expected (see Figure \ref{SpectrumAnalysis}). The flow equations cannot "see" these eigenvalues because the original Hamiltonian is real and the flow equations are algebraically closed in the sense that the flow cannot generate terms from $\C\setminus \R$ if it starts with purely real terms. If the flow equation approach is when complex eigenvalues occur, those will be encoded in behaviour as seen in Figure \ref{FlowIllustrationInsufficient} where not all off-diagonal terms vanish. \\
An important side note: The fact that imaginary eigenvalues occur principally means that formula \ref{GS_energy_formula} does not hold. However, Kain and Ling \cite{PhysRevA.98.033610} argued that it is still applicable if the imaginary parts are relatively small. Looking at the maximal eigenvalues $\sim 70c/\xi$ and the imaginary parts $\sim 1c/\xi$ in Figure \ref{SpectrumAnalysis} justifies our use of formula \ref{GS_energy_formula} when calculating the ground state energy for Figure \ref{GSenergiesBogFlow}.\\
The thermodynamic instability region for $-3.5\gtrsim\eta$, on the other hand, is correctly predicted in accordance with the results obtained by a Bogoliubov transformation, since negative eigenvalues are generally unproblematic for the flow equations, even though a more complicated convergence behavior may result from these negative eigenvalues, as we observed in Figure \ref{FlowIllustrationInsufficient}.

\subsection{Analysis of the Spectrum}
We have seen that the flow equation approach allows for accurate predictions of the ground state energy. The fact that the flow equations simply gloss over the imaginary eigenvalues that can be seen by a Bogoliubov Transformation leads to less good predictions in a small regime around the $\eta$ where the ground state energy diverges. Yet the relative error of these predictions is still small because the absolute error of $\Delta E_0$ in Figure \ref{GSenergiesBogFlow} is bounded whereas the ground energy is not.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/plots/PDF/SpectralAnalysis.pdf}
    \caption[End of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian for different $\eta$]{This plot shows how the largest eigenvalues change in $\eta$. It has been refrained from performing a Bogoliubov transformation after the flow, since this would only reproduce the values of a direct Bogoliubov transformation anyway due to the unitarity of the flow transformation.
}
    \label{EndOfSpectrumAnalysis}
\end{figure}
In the previous section we have also seen that the flow equations predict the negative eigenvalues correctly. Moreover,  Figure \ref{SpectrumAnalysis} showed that the smallest positive real eigenvalue is (almost) constant across the range of $\eta$ we investigated. This is also true for most of the other positive eigenvalues, and only the end of the spectrum shows interesting behavior, so we will take a closer look at that.
Figure \ref{EndOfSpectrumAnalysis} reveals the following features of the spectrum:
\begin{itemize}
\item The smaller the eigenvalue, the less it changes for different values of $\eta$. This is consistent with the fact, as noted above, that the smallest positive real eigenvalue remains virtually unchanged for different values interaction strengths.
\item In the spectrum we get from the flow equations, each eigenvalue appears exactly twice, i.e. each eigenvalue is twofold degenerate. Therefore the flow does not lift the original degeneracy $\omega_k=\omega_{-k}$.
\item In the spectrum we get from the Bogoliubov transformation, the eigenvalues come in pairs too where one eigenvalue remains exactly constant across different interaction strengths. The other increases strictly monotonically with $\eta$.
\item The eigenvalues from the flow spectrum are almost exactly the mean value between the two different values corresponding to a pair in the Bogoliubov spectrum.
\end{itemize}
If this pattern can be continued, it seems plausible, even without knowing details about the flow equations, that no imaginary eigenvalues can be observed with them: Since the original Hamiltonian is purely real, its characteristic polynomial is also purely real, and its zeros must occur in pairs $\lambda,\lambda^*$. But since $\lambda+\lambda^*\in\R$, the flow equations do not see complex eigenvalues.\\
In the next section, we will try to remove the degeneracy in the flow equations, in the hope that better agreement with the spectrum obtained via the Bogoliubov transformation can be achieved.
%The transformation \ref{twisted_trafo} then follows by again discretizing the momentum space. 
\section{Introducing Twisted Boundary Conditions}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/plots/PDF/FlowIllustrationPhi.pdf}
    \caption[Flow Visualization for $\eta=0.2$ and $\varphi = 1$]{Visualization of the flow progression for $\eta=0.2$ and $\varphi = 1$ analogous to Figure \ref{FlowIllustration}. We can see that by introducing the symmetry breaking parameter $\varphi$, all $V_{k,k^\prime}$ decay from the outside, albeit slowly. Yet, considering the shading scale is logarithmic, many $V_{k,k^\prime}$ can be well suppressed even if the flow is stopped at $\lambda=30$.}
    \label{FlowIllustrationPhi}
\end{figure}
We will now try to improve the convergence properties of the off-diagonal matrix elements using the transformation
\begin{equation} \label{twisted_trafo}
\left\{\Delta k_n\right\}_{n\in\Z}\rightarrow \left\{\Delta k_n+\frac{\varphi}{L}\right\}_{n\in\Z}
\end{equation}
 which (slightly) shifts the grid of $k$-values and thereby breaks the symmetry $k\leftrightarrow -k$ by introducing a phase parameter $\varphi\in\R$. Obviously, the original, symmetrical grid is recovered in the limit $\varphi\rightarrow 0$. 
This transformation is not merely a mathematically convenient trick but is also physically meaningful. If we consider our bosonic bath in which the impurity is immersed arranged in circular form we expect periodic boundary conditions
\begin{equation}
\psi(x)=\psi(x+L)
\end{equation}
on a wave function $\psi$ describing some part of the system. However, introducing a magnetic flux $\theta$ in the ring imposes \emph{twisted} periodic boundary conditions:
\begin{equation}
\psi(x)=e^{i\varphi}\psi(x+L)
\end{equation}
It can then be shown \cite{twisted} that these twisted boundary conditions are equivalent to the shift 
\begin{equation}
-i\partial_x\rightarrow -i\partial x+\frac{\varphi}{L}
\end{equation}
or, after recognizing the momentum operator in position representation, 
\begin{equation}
k\rightarrow k+\frac{\varphi}{L}.
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/plots/PDF/Spectral_analysis,N=40.pdf}
    \caption[End of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian with twisted boundary conditions]{This plot shows how the largest eigenvalues change in $\eta$ analogously to Figure \ref{EndOfSpectrumAnalysis} when twisted boundary conditions are in place. We can see that the symmetry breaking helps the convergence of the flow equations to the diagonal Hamiltonian. }
    \label{ConvergenceImprovementsTwisted}
\end{figure}
Indeed, shifting the $k-$grid improves the convergence properties of the $V_{k,k^\prime}$, as seen in Figure \ref{FlowIllustrationPhi}. There the calculations were still based on a $N=200$ grid of $k$-values, just like in the previous section. \\
In the following, we will significantly coarsen the grid to $N=40$ for computational reasons. This is acceptable to get a general idea of the convergence behavior and how the spectrum looks qualitatively, but probably does not allow for quantitatively exact conclusions.
For Figure \ref{ConvergenceImprovementsTwisted} we chose $\varphi\defeq 0.1$. This is a reasonable value because it is large enough to break the symmetry sufficiently much while introducing only a very moderate error of $\sim 1.6\%$ for the smallest $|k|$-value. Hence, the $\omega_k$, $V_{k,k^\prime}$ and $W_{k,k^\prime}$ in the original Hamiltonian have an error of the same order.\\
Since the symmetry of the diagonal part of the original Hamiltonian is now broken, the eigenvalues of the flow Hamiltonian are also no longer degenerate. We obtain a quantitatively very good agreement between the eigenvalues resulting from a Bogoliubov transformation and the predictions of the flow equations for large eigenvalues. Unfortunately, this does not hold for small eigenvalues.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/plots/PDF/Spectral_analysis,N=40_beginning_of_spectrum.pdf}
    \caption[Beginning of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian with twisted boundary conditions]{This plot shows how the smallest eigenvalues change in $\eta$ analogously to Figure \ref{EndOfSpectrumAnalysis} when twisted boundary conditions are in place. We notice a slight discrepancy between the results obtained via Bogoliubov Transformation and via the Flow Equations.}
    \label{ConvergenceTwistedSmallEigenvalues}
\end{figure}
However, it is assumed that these discrepancies in Figure \ref{ConvergenceTwistedSmallEigenvalues} can be largely resolved by refining the $k$ grid, since we have very good agreement between the two methods for the top and bottom eigenvalues. Smaller distances between neighboring $k$ values mean, of course, smaller distances between the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian and thus smaller distances between the eigenvalues we obtain via the flow equations and the Bogoliubov transformation, respectively.\\
The right convergence to the spectrum of the Hamiltonian thanks to the twisted boundary conditions also resolves the discrepancies we observed in Figure \ref{GSenergiesBogFlow} and almost perfect agreement of the ground state energies via Bogoliubov transformation and the flow equations can be obtained, as seen in Figure \ref{ConvergenceImprovementsTwisted}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/plots/PDF/GS_energies_bog_flow_comp_N=40.pdf}
    \caption[Ground state energy with twisted boundary conditions]{This plot shows how the ground state energy changes in $\eta$ analogously to Figure \ref{GSenergiesBogFlow} when twisted boundary conditions are in place. We can see that the symmetry breaking helps in reaching agreement between the Bogoliubov transformation and the flow equations. The quantitative disagreement to Figure \ref{GSenergiesBogFlow} is grounded in the significantly coarser grid for this plot here and, to a lesser extend, the error introduced by the twisted boundary conditions.}
    \label{ConvergenceImprovementsTwisted}
\end{figure}
 %Kain and Ling \cite{PhysRevA.98.033610} investigated the same problem for a similar set of parameters. Apart from exact diagonalization by Bogoliubov transformation they also used a mean-field
\section{Qualitative Convergence Analysis}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/plots/PDF/Convergence_analysis,N=40.pdf}
    \caption[Convergence behavior of the spectrum for selected $\eta$]{This plot illustrates that the rate of convergence is not uniform across the spectrum by plotting how the largest and smallest positive eigenvalues for two selected $\eta$ evolve in the flow. It becomes evident that larger eigenvalues converge considerably faster than smaller eigenvalues.}
    \label{ConvergenceRate}
\end{figure}
Looking qualitatively at the convergence behavior of the eigenvalues whose flow evolution is shown in Figure \ref{ConvergenceRate}, it seems likely that the discrepancies between the flow equation approach and the exact solution for small eigenvalues are largely due to the fact that the lower end of the spectrum converges much slower than the upper part of the spectrum. This is to be expected since $\partial_\lambda\omega_k$ in the flow equation \ref{feq_won_I} is smaller for smaller $|\omega_k|$. Furthermore, when using the canonical generator, the flow equation approach always works by first decoupling matrix elements that couple modes with large energy differences. This means that $V_{k,k^\prime},W_{k,k^\prime}$ generally converge faster if $\omega_k,\omega_{k^\prime}$ are larger and that the flow equations work their way through Hilbert space starting by transforming states whose energies are high. Thus, the flow transforms the states associated with lower energies later, and the corresponding eigenvalues also settle to a constant value later in the flow.
